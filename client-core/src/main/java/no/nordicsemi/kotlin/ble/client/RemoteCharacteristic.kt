    /**
     * Enables notifications or indications, depending on the characteristic's properties.
     *
     * This method writes to the Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor (CCCD)
     * belonging to this characteristic to enable or disable notifications or indications.
     *
     * Note: [subscribe] or [waitForValueChange] enable notifications automatically.
     *
     * ### Example
     *
     * This snippet shows how the notifications can be enabled and disabled synchronously:
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * remoteCharacteristic.setNotifying(true)
     * println("Notifications are enabled: ${remoteCharacteristic.isNotifying}") // -> true
     * ```
     *
     * ## Race Condition Warning
     *
     * Using `setNotifying(true)` can lead to a race condition where the peripheral sends a
     * notification before the app is ready to collect it, causing the first value to be missed.
     *
     * **It is strongly recommended to use [subscribe] or [waitForValueChange] instead.**
     * These Flow-based APIs guarantee that the listener is active *before* notifications are
     * enabled on the peripheral, preventing data loss.
     *
     * ### Example
     * ```kotlin
     * remoteCharacteristic
     *    .subscribe {
     *       // Here, the notifications are 100% enabled.
     *       println("Notifications are enabled: ${remoteCharacteristic.isNotifying}") // -> true
     *    }
     *    .catch {
     *       // Catch an exception if subscribe() failed.
     *    }
     *    .collect {
     *        // [...]
     *    }
     *
     * // The Flow is cold. Notifications are not yet enabled.
     * println("Notifications are enabled: ${remoteCharacteristic.isNotifying}") // -> false
     * ```
     * @param enabled True to enable notifications or indications, false to disable them.
     * @throws OperationFailedException if the operation failed.
     * @throws InvalidAttributeException if the characteristic has been invalidated due to
     * disconnection or service change event.
     * @throws BluetoothException if the implementation fails, see [BluetoothException.cause] for
     * a reason.
