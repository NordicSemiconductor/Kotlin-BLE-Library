     * Returns a flow emitting [RemoteServices] events.
     *
     * ## Overview
     *
     * This method is the main entry point to discover GATT services on the peripheral and observe
     * changes in the services. It returns a flow that emits the current state of service discovery
     * process, which can be observed to get the list of services when they are discovered, or to
     * handle errors when service discovery fails.
     *
     * Note, that the flow may emit [RemoteServices.Discovered] state multiple times, for example
     * when the peripheral reconnects or when the services get invalidated and rediscovered.
     * This is not a one-time operation, but a continuous observation of the services on the peripheral.
     *
     * ## State machine
     *
     * Initially, the state is [Unknown][RemoteServices.Unknown]. Shortly after calling [services]
     * the flow will emit [Discovering][RemoteServices.Discovering] state, followed by
     * [Discovered][RemoteServices.Discovered] state, or (unlikely) [Failed][RemoteServices.Failed]
     * state, where the reason of the failure is given as a parameter
     * [Failed.reason][RemoteServices.Failed.reason].
     *
     * When in [Discovered][RemoteServices.Discovered] or [Failed][RemoteServices.Failed], and the
     * service will get invalidated, either due to a disconnection or Service Change indication
     * sent from the remote peripheral, the state will transition to [Unknown][RemoteServices.Unknown].
     *
     * Service change will automatically request service discovery, which, when complete, will emit
     * [Discovered][RemoteServices.Discovered] state with new set of services.
     *
     * ```
     *                           (Initial state)
     *                                  │
     *        ┌───────────────>      Unknown     <────────────────┐
     *        │                         │                         │
     * (disconnection)     (service discovery started)    (disconnection)
     *        │                         ↓                         │
     *     Failed <── (failure) ─── Discovering ─── (done) ──> Discovered
     *
     * ```
     *
     * @param uuids An optional list of service UUID to filter the results. If empty, all services
     *        will be returned. Some platforms may do partial service discovery and return only
     *        services with given UUIDs.
     * @return A state flow with the current state of service discovery process. If the method
     * was called with a [uuids] filter, the [RemoteServices.Discovered] state will contain only
     * services with given UUIDs, otherwise it will contain all services returned by the
     * system. If the returned list is empty, the service was not found on the peripheral.
     */

    /**
     * Registers a profile implementation that runs when the specified GATT service is discovered.
     *
     * ## Overview
     *
     * Decouples the Bluetooth LE profile interface from application logic, allowing each
     * device feature (profile) to run in its own coroutine.
     *
     * Multiple profiles can be added by calling this method once for each service,
     * i.e. Battery Profile and Heart Rate Profile.
     *
     * This method suspends only to get the current coroutine scope using [currentCoroutineContext].
     * The [block] is called in a child coroutine.
     *
     * ## Services
     *
     * As `profile` is using [services] under the hood, it is safe and recommended to call this method
     * before connecting the peripheral.
     *
     * The [block] will be called every time the services are discovered,
     * which may happen multiple times (e.g. when the peripheral reconnects, or when the service
     * gets invalidated and rediscovered). To stop observing services cancel the job in which this
     * method is called, or use the `profile` method with custom scope.
     *
     * If multiple services share the same [serviceUuid], only the first one is passed to `block`.
     *
     * ## Validation
     *
     * If the profile was marked as [required] and the service is not found,
     * or the `block` throws [IllegalArgumentException] during service validation, the connection
     * will be terminated with reason
     * [RequiredServiceNotFound][ConnectionState.Disconnected.Reason.RequiredServiceNotFound].
     *
     * ## Block completion
     *
     * The device will NOT be disconnected when the [block] ends, unless the situation described
     * in the Validation section.
     *
     * ## Example
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * override suspend fun connect(
     *     block: suspend CoroutineScope.(HeartRateProfile.State) -> Unit,
     * ): Unit = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
     *     // First, register profile.

     *
     *     // Await disconnection.
     *     peripheral.awaitDisconnection()
     * }
     * ```

     * @param required Whether the service is required. In example, a Heart Rate app may require
     * a Heart Rate Service, but also support an optional Battery Service to indicate the battery
     * level.
     * @param name An optional name of the profile, used only in log messages. This is useful when

    /**
     * Registers a profile implementation that runs when the specified GATT services are discovered.
     *
     * ## Overview
     *
     * Decouples the Bluetooth LE profile interface from application logic, allowing each
     * device feature (profile) to run in its own coroutine.
     *
     * Multiple profiles can be added by calling this method once for each service,
     * i.e. Battery Profile and Heart Rate Profile.
     *
     * This method suspends only to get the current coroutine scope using [currentCoroutineContext].
     * The profile is executed in a child coroutine.
     *
     * ## Services
     *
     * As `profile` is using [services] under the hood, it is safe and recommended to call this method
     * before connecting the peripheral.
     *
     * The profile will be executed every time the services are discovered,
     * which may happen multiple times (e.g. when the peripheral reconnects, or when the service
     * gets invalidated and rediscovered). To stop observing services cancel the [scope].
     *
     * ## Validation
     *
     * If the profile was marked as [required] and at least one of the required services is not found,
     * or the `block` throws [IllegalArgumentException] during service validation, the connection
     * will be terminated with reason
     * [RequiredServiceNotFound][ConnectionState.Disconnected.Reason.RequiredServiceNotFound].
