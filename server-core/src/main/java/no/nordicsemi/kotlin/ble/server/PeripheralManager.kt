     * Creates services definition in the local GATT server.
     *
     * The services will be available for connected central devices upon connection and
     * service discovery. Each central will have access to its own instances of the services
     * (see [services]).
     *
     * Sample code:
     * ```
     * peripheralManager.setup {
     *    // Define one or more services using the DSL:
     *    Service(<Some UUID>) {
     *       // For each service, define characteristics and descriptors:

     *       ) {
     *          // Note:
     *          // Client Characteristic Configuration descriptor is added automatically when
     *          // NOTIFY or INDICATE property is set.
     *          // Similarly, Characteristic Extended Properties descriptor is added when
     *          // RELIABLE_WRITE and/or WRITE_AUXILIARIES property is set, or when
     *          // the Characteristic User Description descriptor is added as writable.
     *
     *          // Define descriptors for the characteristic using the following syntax:
     *          Descriptor(
     *             uuid = <Some UUID>,
     *             permissions = Permission.READ
     *          )
     *
     *          // The Characteristic User Description descriptor can be added using a simple
     *          // function call:
     *          CharacteristicUserDescriptionDescriptor(
     *             description = "Some description",
     *             writable = false // default value
     *          )
     *       }
     *       // You may define more characteristics for the service:
     *       Characteristic(
     *          uuid = <Some UUID>,
     *          properties = CharacteristicProperty.WRITE,
     *          permissions = Permission.WRITE
     *       )
     *       // The primary service may contain inner services defined the same way:
     *       InnerService(<Some UUID>) {
     *          Characteristic(...)
     *       }
     *    }
     *    Service(<Some UUID>) {
     *       Characteristic(...)
     *    }
     * }
     * ```
     * You may also define characteristics as methods:
     * ```kotlin
     * fun ServerScope.HeartRateService(builder: PrimaryServiceScope.() -> Unit = {}) {
     *     Service(
     *         uuid = UUID.fromString("0000180D-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"),
     *         builder = builder
     *     )
     * }
     *
     * fun ServiceScope.HeartRateMeasurementCharacteristic() {
     *     Characteristic(
     *         uuid = UUID.fromString("00002A37-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"),
     *         properties = CharacteristicProperty.READ and CharacteristicProperty.NOTIFY,
     *         permission = Permission.READ,
     *     )
     * }
     * ```
     * And then use it in the service definition:
     * ```kotlin
     * HeartRateService {
     *    HeartRateMeasurementCharacteristic()
     * }
     *
     * @param builder The primary service definition scope.
