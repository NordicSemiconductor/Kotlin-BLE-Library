     * Bluetooth LE connection parameters.
     *
     * ### Connection Interval
     *
     * A Bluetooth LE device spends most of its time “sleeping” (hence the “Low Energy” in the name).
     * In a connection, this is accomplished by agreeing on a connection interval saying how often the
     * devices will communicate with each other. When they are done communicating, they will turn off
     * the radio, set a timer and go into idle mode, and when the timer times out, they will both wake
     * up and communicate again. The implementation of this is handled by the Bluetooth LE stack, but
     * it is up to your application to decide how often you want the devices to communicate by setting
     * the connection interval.
     *
     * ### Connection latency
     *
     * Peripheral latency allows the peripheral to skip waking up for a certain number of connection
     * events if it doesn't have any data to send. Usually, the connection interval is a strict tradeoff
     * between power consumption and low latency or delay in communication. If you want to reduce the
     * latency, but still keep a low power consumption, you can use peripheral latency.
     * This is particularly useful in HID (Human Interface Devices) applications, such as computer
     * mouse and keyboard applications, which usually don’t have any data to send, but when it has
     * data to send, we want to have very low latency. Using the peripheral latency option, we can
     * maintain low latency but reduce power consumption by remaining idle for several connection intervals.
     *
     * ### Supervision timeout
     *
     * When two devices are connected, they agree on a parameter that determines how long it should
     * take since the last packet was successfully received until the devices consider the connection lost.
     * This is called the supervision timeout. So if one of the devices is unexpectedly switched off,
     * runs out of battery, or if the devices are out of radio range, then this is the amount of time
     * it takes between successfully receiving the last packet before the connection is considered lost.
     *
     * @param connectionInterval Connection interval in 1.25ms unit.
     *        Valid range is from 6 (7.5ms) to 3200 (4000ms).
     * @param latency Connection latency. Valid range is from 0 to 499.
     * @param supervisionTimeout Supervision timeout in 10ms unit.
     *        Valid range is from 10 (0.1s) to 3200 (32s)
