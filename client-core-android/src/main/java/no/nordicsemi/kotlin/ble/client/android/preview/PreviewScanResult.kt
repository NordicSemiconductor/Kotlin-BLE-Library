/**
 * Preview implementation of [ScanResult] for showing scan results on Compose previews.
 *
 * @param peripheral The peripheral associated with the scan result.
 * @param isConnectable Whether the peripheral is connectable. Use `null` if the API doesn't
 * provide this information.
 * @param advertisingData The advertising data associated with the scan result. By default, this
 * is set to the result of [fromName] using the peripheral's name.
 * @param rssi The received signal strength (RSSI) in dBm, defaults to -50 dBm.
 * @param txPowerLevel The transmission power level.
 * @param primaryPhy The primary PHY used to transmit the advertisement, defaults to PHY LE 1M.
 * @param secondaryPhy The secondary PHY used to transmit the advertisement, or `null` (default) if not used.
 * @param timestamp The timestamp since when the scan record was observed.
