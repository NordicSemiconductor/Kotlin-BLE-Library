     * All prepared writes should be queued until the Execute Write request is received.

     *
     * Android and iOS automatically use *Long Write* procedure when the value to be written

     * ### Reliable Write
     *
     * *Reliable Write* procedure is used to ensure that the data is transmitted correctly
     * to the peripheral before committing the changes. The client sends multiple Prepare Write requests,
     * each containing a part of the value, and the peripheral responds with the same data to
     * confirm that it was received correctly. If any part of the data is incorrect, the
     * operation will be canceled automatically using Execute Write request with `execute` flag
     * set to `false`.
